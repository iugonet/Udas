 "iug_load_meteor_srp_txt" was added to a new option command so that users
can select two kinds of dawnload files since both the 1-day and 1-month files
are avaiable now.
Please see the header document for details of the options. 

3) "iug_load_meteor_srp_nc" for the meteor wind radar data at Serpon revised
