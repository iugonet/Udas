FUNCTION:	cal_rot(v1,v2)
INPUT:	
	v1:	3 component vector,		
	v2:	3 component vector,		
PURPOSE:
	Returns a rotation matrix that rotates v1,v2 to the x-y plane
	v1 is rotated to the x-axis and v2 into the x-y plane
NOTES:	
	Function normally called by &quot;add_df2d.pro&quot; to rotate
	velocities into the plane of Vsw and B

Procedure:	thm_esa_slice2d

Purpose:	creates a 2-D slice of the 3-D ESA ion or electron distribution function.

Call:		thm_esa_slice2d,sc,typ,current_time,timeinterval,[keywords]

Keywords:	SPECIES: 'ion' or 'ele'
           ROTATION: suggesting the x and y axis, which can be specified as the followings:
             'BV': the x axis is V_para (to the magnetic field) and the bulk velocity is in the x-y plane. (DEFAULT)
             'BE': the x axis is V_para (to the magnetic field) and the VxB direction is in the x-y plane.
             'xy': the x axis is V_x and the y axis is V_y.
             'xz': the x axis is V_x and the y axis is V_z.
             'yz': the x axis is V_y and the y axis is V_z.
             'perp': the x-y plane is perpendicular to the B field, while the x axis is the velocity projection on the plane.
             'perp_xy': the x-y plane is perpendicular to the B field, while the x axis is the x projection on the plane.
             'perp_xz': the x-y plane is perpendicular to the B field, while the x axis is the x projection on the plane.
             'perp_yz': the x-y plane is perpendicular to the B field, while the x axis is the y projection on the plane.
           ANGLE: the lower and upper angle limits of the slice selected to plot (DEFAULT [-20,20]).
           THIRDDIRLIM: the velocity limits of the slice. Once activated, the ANGLE keyword would be invalid..
           FILETYPE: 'png' or 'ps'. (DEFAULT 'png')
           OUTPUTFILE: the name of the output file.
			THEBDATA: specifies magnetic data to use.
			FINISHED: makes the output publication quality when using ps (NOT WORKING WELL).
			XRANGE: vector specifying the xrange
			RANGE: vector specifying the color range
			ERANGE: specifies the energy range to be used
			UNITS: specifies the units ('eflux','df',etc.) (Def. is 'df')
			NOZLOG: specifies a linear Z axis
			POSITION: positions the plot using a 4-vector
			NOFILL: doesn't fill the contour plot with colors
			NLINES: says how many lines to use if using NOFILL (DEFAULT 60, MAX 60)
			NOOLINES: suppresses the black contour lines
			NUMOLINES: how many black contour lines (DEFAULT 20, MAX 60)
           REMOVEZERO: removes the data with zero counts for plotting
			SHOWDATA: plots all the data points over the contour
			VEL: tplot variable containing the velocity data
			     (default is calculated with v_3d)
			NOGRID: forces no triangulation
			NOSMOOTH: suppresses smoothing (IF NOT SET, DEFAULT IS SMOOTH)
			NOSUN: suppresses the sun direction line
			NOVELLINE: suppresses the velocity line
           SUBTRACT: subtract the bulk velocity before plot
			RESOLUTION: resolution of the mesh (DEFAULT 51)
			RMBINS: removes the sun noise by cutting out certain bins
			THETA: specifies the theta range for RMBINS (def 20)
			PHI: specifies the phi range for RMBINS (def 40)
			NR: removes background noise from ph using noise_remove
			NOISELEVEL: background level in eflux
			BOTTOM: level to set as min eflux for background. def. is 0.
			SR, RS, RM2: removes the sun noise using subtraction
				REQUIRES write_ph.doc to run
			NLOW: used with rm2.  Sets bottom of eflux noise level
				def. 1e4
			M: marks the tplot at the current time
			VEL2: takes a 3-vector velocity and puts it on the plot
CREATED BY:		Arjun Raj
EXAMPLES:  see the crib file: themis_cut_crib.pro
REMARKS:		when calling with phb and rm2, use file='write_phb.doc'
			also, set the noiselevel to 1e5.  This gives the best
			results
