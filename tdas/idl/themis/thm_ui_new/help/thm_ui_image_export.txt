The Export to Image Menu allows you to generate an image file of your 
currently active page.   The THEMIS GUI supports the following file types:  
Portable Network Graphics (.png), Encapsulated Postscript (.eps), Windows 
Meta-File (.emf, Windows Only), Windows Bitmap (.bmp), Graphics Interchange 
Format (.gif), Joint Photographic Experts Format/JPEG (.jpg), JPEG 2000 
(.jp2), Apple PICT format (.pic), Portable Picture Map (.ppm), Sun Raster 
Format (.srf).

The directory to which you will output is listed at the top.  The 'Arrow' 
button will allow you to move up one directory.  You can also edit the 
directory by typing directly into the directory field, or selecting the 
desired directory from the directory list below. The file name for output 
is listed in the text box at the bottom.  Change the output format by 
selecting a different type from the 'Save As' dropdown menu at the bottom.  
The 'Options' button will show the graphics output options for the selected 
file type.  These options will change depending on the file type.  They 
involve things like the size and resolution of the output file.  
When you are ready to actually save the file, select the 'Save' button, 
and the requested file will be saved to the selected directory.  If you 
change your mind select the 'Cancel' button or the 'X' in the corner. 

NOTES:  
1) .EPS and .EMF both support vector output, which is needed if you want 
to resize without pixelation or load the file into Illustrator to select 
individual labels and ticks for editing.   To turn on vector output for 
either of these format types, press the 'Options' button and select 'Vector'.  
2) Setting line plot resolution at or past 70% can make the file unreadable 
due to the size of the file.
